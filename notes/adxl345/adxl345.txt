BASIC SENSOR SETUP:

- In my BoB CSN pin is connected to Vddio. Therefore, IC is on I2C communication mode.
- Also, SDA and SCL pins pulled-up with 4.7k resistors.
- Address: 0x53 (SDO/ALT ADDRESS pin grounded in the BoB)
		0xA6 to write, 0xA7 to read

Measurement data register fields:
2's compliment
Least Significant - Most Significant
0x31 : data_format register
0x32, 0x33 : x-axis
0x34, 0x35 : y-axis
0x36, 0x37 : z-axis
It is recommended that a multiple-byte read of all registers be performed to prevent a change in data between reads of sequential registers.


1) Write to POWER_CTL register (0x2D) 0x08. This puts the device into measure mode from standby mode.
2) Read 6 bytes from 0x32
