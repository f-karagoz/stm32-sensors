# STM32 Single Sensor Projects #

>This repository contains seperate sensor studies I have done using only the datasheets of the common sensors. <br/>
Feel free use the code I have created for your project. One rule though, just do not remove any header I have put over my driver and API files. <br/>

## Available Projects
- ADXL345 accelerometer **(development in progress)** <br/>

## Upcoming Projects
- BME680 gas sensor
- DS1302 real time clock
- MCP9808 temperature sensor
- SHT30 temperature sensor

<br/>
Here is the simplified SW architecture followed when creating the projects in this repository:<br/><br/>
